[Verse 1]
There once was a ship that put to sea
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
Blow, me bully boys, blow (Huh!)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 2]
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (Hah!)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 3]
Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below (Huh!)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 4]
No line was cut, no whale was freed;
The Captain's mind was not on greed
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 5]
For forty days, or even more
The line went slack, then tight once more
All boats were lost, there were only four
But still that whale did go

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 6]
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his a regular call
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all

[Chorus]
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

[Verse 1]
Oh! Santiana gained a day
Away Santiana!
"Napoleon of the West", they say
Along the plains of Mexico

[Chorus]
Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

[Verse 2]
She's a fast clipper ship and a bully good crew
Away Santiana!
And an old salty yank for a captain too
Along the plains of Mexico

[Chorus]
Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

[Verse 3]
Santiana fought for gold
Away Santiana!
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow
Along the plains of Mexico

[Chorus]
Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

[Verse 4]
T'was on the field of Molly-Del-Ray
Away Santiana!
Well both his legs got blown away
Along the plains of Mexico

[Chorus]
Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

[Verse 5]
It was a fierce and bitter strife
Away Santiana!
The general Taylor took his life
Along the plains of Mexico

[Chorus]
Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

[Verse 6]
Santiana, now we mourn
Away Santiana!
We left him buried off Cape Horn
Along the plains of Mexico

A young boy I was, barely out of my home
I stepped to the world with a meaning to roam
I signed with a captain who promised me gold
And adventure to quicken the heart of the bold

For fourteen odd years I did struggle alone
For the cause I worked my fingers down to the bone
Saw naught but the scuppers, saw naught of my pay
Then was cast off and sent on my way

A curse upon you! Sorrow fall thick and fast!
Your days have been numbered, each hour your last!
May the land, sea or sky turn to swallow you whole
And fore'er ne'er forget what you stole!

I found me some cohorts, the bravest and true
No captain was prouder to call such men crew
They could rally a cry and the battle was won
I'd face off a cannon if they but looked on

The mutinous dogs bound my hands while I slept
Swapped their honour for treasures and gold that we kept
Threw me over the side with all kindness I'd shown
Now I vow to sail always alone

A curse upon you! Sorrow fall thick and fast!
Your days have been numbered, each hour your last!
May the land, sea or sky turn to swallow you whole
And fore'er ne'er forget what you stole!

I met a fair maiden one round upon shore
I fell for her smile as I'd ne'er done before
I pledged her my world for as long as I lived
I'd have offered her more if I had more to give

My pockets she emptied, still I offered the rest
She obliged and then ripped out the heart from my chest
She sent me adrift, free to float to world's end
With a bottle as my only friend

A curse upon you! Sorrow fall thick and fast!
Your days have been numbered, each hour your last!
May the land, sea or sky turn to swallow you whole
And fore'er ne'er forget what you stole!

Now maybe there's some of you wondering hence
Not all parts of my life fit together with sense
If these are your thoughts, allow me to explain
Listen close now for I will not say it again

I curse you yourself with the doubts that you've shown!
For this is my life and I made it my own
Walk a path and you'll have your own stories in time
Till that day, I shall drink just to mine

A curse upon you! Sorrow fall thick and fast!
Your days have been numbered, each hour your last!
May the land, sea or sky turn to swallow you whole
And fore'er ne'er forget what you stole!

[Verse 1]
Come me boys and heave with me
Let's get off this curs-ed sea
Let's be home to lovers and wives
And leave behind these four hour lives

[Chorus]
(Four Hours)
Workin' on the swell
(Four Hours)
Sloggin' in the rain
(Four Hours)
Workin' to the bell
(Then Four Hours)
'til it starts again

[Verse 2]
Come me boys and heave with me
The wind's my friend and my enemy
It carries me home but it must be tamed
Everything lost or everything gained

[Chorus]
(Four Hours)
Workin' on the swell
(Four Hours)
Sloggin' in the rain
(Four Hours)
Workin' to the bell
(Then Four Hours)
'til it starts again

[Verse 3]
Come me boys and heave with me
Got scabrous hands and bloody knees
When the bell tolls, I'll go below
My hands will callous and my strength will grow

[Chorus]
(Four Hours)
Workin' on the swell
(Four Hours)
Sloggin' in the rain
(Four Hours)
Workin' to the bell
(Then Four Hours)
'til it starts again

[Verse 4]
Come me boys and heave away
Soaked and heavy heaving under the spray
Will I ever shed this salt on my brow?
Better the dust from under my plow

[Chorus]
(Four Hours)
Workin' on the swell
(Four Hours)
Sloggin' in the rain
(Four Hours)
Workin' to the bell
(Then Four Hours)
'til it starts again

[Verse 5]
When I'm back in Bristol town
I'll buy my love a silken gown
We'll lie in each others arms and rest
Until that bell sounds in my chest

[Chorus]
(Four Hours)
Workin' on the swell
(Four Hours)
Sloggin' in the rain
(Four Hours)
Workin' to the bell
(Then Four Hours)
'til it starts again

Four Hours
Haulin' on the sheets!
Four Hours
Keepin' our feet!
Four Hours
Wrap me in the shroud
Then Four Hours
Lay me in the ground

[Verse 1]
Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine;
Come lift up your voices all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

[Chorus]
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass;
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

[Verse 2]
Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well
For her style and her beauty, sure none can excel
There's a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee
There's no man in this wide world as happy as me

[Chorus]
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass;
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

[Verse 3]
Our ship lies at anchor, she's ready to dock
I wish her safe landing, without any shock
If ever I should meet you by land or by sea
(I will always remember your kindness to me.)

[Chorus]
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass;
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again

Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass;
Let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain
For we may or might never all meet here again
